# Insurance-claims-over-cars
Car Insurance Claim dataset is used to see which insured client asks the car insurance company to compensate him/her for the damages that are sustained by his/her car after an accident.

In this project using the dataset we have trained two Machine Learning algorithms to predict if the customer will claim his/her insurance or not and compare the result of these two algorithms.
