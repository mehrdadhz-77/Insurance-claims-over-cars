# 🚗 Insurance Claims Over Cars – EDA & Predictive Modeling

**An end‑to‑end analysis pipeline: from cleaning insurance claims data to training a predictive model.**

---

## 🧾 Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on car insurance claims data, and then proceeds to **train a machine learning model** to predict whether a customer is likely to file a claim. It combines insights from historical data with predictive modeling to support business decisions in insurance.

## 🔍 Analysis & Modeling Workflow

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and prepare both categorical and numeric features for analysis and modeling.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
  Visualize and summarize key metrics such as claim frequency, average claim amount, policyholder demographics, and claim distributions over time and geographical regions.

- **Feature Engineering**  
  Create relevant predictors such as policy duration, vehicle age, driver risk factors, and coverage types.

- **Predictive Modeling**  
  Train and evaluate classification models (e.g. logistic regression, decision tree, random forest) on the binary outcome of whether a customer submitted a claim.

- **Model Evaluation**  
  Assess performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall. Identify the best performing model.

- **Feature Importance**  
  Analyze which variables have the strongest predictive power—such as vehicle age, driver demographics, or policy attributes.

## 📊 Key Findings

- **High-frequency and high-cost insurance claims**—patterns across vehicle types, ages, and regions.  
- **Top predictors for claim submission**—features such as driving history, age, and vehicle characteristics.  
- **Best-performing classification model**—including accuracy/F1-score metrics and top features driving prediction.
